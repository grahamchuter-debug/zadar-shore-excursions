              {SITE.name} is an independent planning resource for cruise passengers calling at Zadar. Whether you have one day ashore or want to understand the historic centre, Krka, Šibenik and the Dalmatian coast before you sail, our goal is to help you choose the best version of Dalmatia — not just browse a catalogue of tours.
            </p>
            <p>
              We focus on the practical decisions that shape a good Zadar cruise day: the historic centre or Krka, whether independent exploring suits your hours, when a small-group tour beats a large coach, and how to build a realistic return-to-ship buffer for coastal roads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our guides are written for real cruise timings, not generic tourism. We highlight honest editorial comparisons, Editor&apos;s Collection recommendations for different traveller types, and future concepts such as The Wow Collection and Signature Dalmatian Discovery. Ship schedules and transfer times are indicative — always confirm all-aboard times with your cruise line.
